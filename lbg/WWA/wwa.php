    <p>Lunch by George normally serves 40-50 people per day, with an occasional 'spike' to the 60-70 range 
          and over 100 at our Christmas meal. The program operates five days a week, opening at 9:00 a.m. with 
          coffee and snacks and serving soup at 10:00 a.m. and a hot nutritious lunch at 11:00 a.m.. Normally 
          the dishes are done and the kitchen cleaned up before noon, which leaves the hall available for other 
          groups in the afternoon.</p>

      <p>Many of the patrons have some form of disability - mental or physical - which prevents them from 
          working. Many of these patrons have been coming for a number of years. Lunch by George is their social 
          centre; they know each other and care for each other. A few are elderly and in poor circumstances.</p>

      <p>A survey done several years ago showed that most were on disability, pension or welfare assistance, 
          with rents consuming 30 to 50% of their incomes. Many have no cooking facilities - maybe just a hotplate 
          - and limited opportunity to cook in a functional kitchen. Yet other patrons are only temporary: they are 
          those who are employable but are having difficulty finding work. They use our services until their 
          status improves or they move to another community with better employment prospects.</p>

          <p>Over the last two or three years the numbers attending the Lunch Program have been gradually increasing 
          - due to cutbacks in support programs for the poor and fewer employment opportunities. We are glad that 
          we can keep the kitchen open five days a week, fifty-one weeks of the year, to help support folks in need.</p>
